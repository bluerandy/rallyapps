build-dashboard
===============

Select a build, show associated change sets and test case results

Needs to be upgraded to current SDK2

Wishlist
============
- Add treeview for changesets.  Expand changeset to see list of changes..  w/ links to change's URLs.
- Add treeview for test cases.  Group by Test Set for each build.
- Build selector is slow.  Too many builds to load.  Pre-load or cut back on # of builds loaded.
- In Build Selector, search by Build Number, not Message field.  It should be a search by Build ID.



Todo
